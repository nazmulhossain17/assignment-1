                <p>One of the better ways to help the poor and needy people is to give them a hand up rather than a hand out. Giving them moral support, showing heartfelt humility and respect makes them aware that someone really does care about them and trying to improve their condition.</p>

                    Their goal is to let kids be kids, regardless of illness. It's all about re-capturing that elusive magic of childhood and making awful stays in the hospital that little bit better. They're one of our top picks for Christmas charity donations.</p>
